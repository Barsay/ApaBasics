# ApaBasics
This project contains simple programming algoritms library in C language, containing details on how they work, their  computational costs, etc.
For every function has a Doxygen description.
For now it's a work in progress.

main.c contains simple tests for every function.

## Algorithms featured in this library: 
### Recursive algorithms:
### Mathematical:
